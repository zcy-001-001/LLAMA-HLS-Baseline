# LLAMA-HLS-Baseline
This repository provides an HLS-based implementation of Tiny-LLAMA and Llama 2B. We have included detailed host files, configuration files, and the src directory, as well as a ready-to-run bitstream file. 

You can follow the README to run the C-level simulation , software emulation , hardware emulation , and the full hardware implementation. 

For Tiny-llama, you can refer to the **Tiny-llama-baseline** branch as the baseline. For For llama2-7B, you can refer to the **llama2-7B-baseline** branch as the baseline.
